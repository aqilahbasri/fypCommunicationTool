Konnichiwa ~ evefaustina's notes ~

1. All activities need to extend BaseActivity, however an error I have yet to figure out: bottom bar of all modules are different... so yeah
2. Do not use setContentView for subclasses. Or not the navigation drawer will not work.
3. To change toolbar title, add onResume() method in each fragment. Syntax: ((BaseActivity) getActivity()).setTitle("<YOUR TITLE>");
4. navDrawer and nav_drawer_content files removed because not needed

More to come
